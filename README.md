#CoreMVVMLearningz
An expirmental, pointless, yet pleasant application being written as part of the author's self-study schedule. 

##Technology and Toolset
This is a WPF desktop application written in C sharp/.NET Core, using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition. 

The code is organized in an M/V/VM design pattern, facilitated in large part by the lightweight [Stylet](https://github.com/canton7/Stylet) package.

##What does it do?
The application displays some pleasant text. This text can be edited. A facility to check that the edited text is still pleasant is not yet implemented, but is very much in the pipline. 

##Licence
This code is made available under the MIT Licence.
